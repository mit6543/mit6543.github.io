## Course Description
This class is a joint Harvard-MIT graduate course on topics of recent interest in quantum complexity theory, especially focusing on the area of Hamiltonian complexity.

## Course Information
**Instructors:** [Anurag Anshu](https://anuraganshu.seas.harvard.edu/) (anuraganshu at fas dot harvard dot edu), [Anand Natarajan](https://www.mit.edu/~anandn/) (anandn at mit dot edu).

**Teaching fellows/assistants:** [Yeongwoo Hwang](https://hwangy.github.io/), [Tina Zhang](https://tuneful-triangulist.github.io/website/)

**Space-time coördinates:** Class meetings may be split between MIT and Harvard based on student demand, TBD. Recordings will be made available for those who cannot make class meeting times.

MIT: Tuesdays & Thursdays 11:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., [36-153](https://whereis.mit.edu/?go=36), Harvard: TBD

**Our first class meeting will be Thursday 9/4 at MIT!**
